# Clustering-Customer-Segmentation-with-K-Means

Several clustering methods will be explored in this project to try to determine the appropriate number of clusters for feature definition of an unsupervised learning customer segmentation problem.  First, a matrix with a binary indicator will be created for whether customers responded to a given offer or not.  NAN values will be converted to zero.  K-Means clustering will be performed using the Elbow, Silhouette and Gap Statistic method.  Principal Component Analysis will also be performed to shed some light on number of dimensions ideal for this data set.  Finally, other clustering algorithms will be explored, such as Agglomerative Clustering, Spectral Clustering, Affinity Propagation and DBSCAN will be executed for further analysis.
